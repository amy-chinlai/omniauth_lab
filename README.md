# Feature Requests Tracker

## Flatiron software engineering, phase 3 project

This Ruby on Rails project provides a web app to submit feature requests, vote on feature requests, and categorize feature requests. This is meant for use for product managers implementing a cooperative development model.

A user must create a unique username and password, or use Facebook login. The user can then create feature requests and vote on other users' feature requests. Admins (which must be assigned through `rails console`) can also create and delete categories.
